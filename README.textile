p. Because I wanted to use the Twitter API and I thought it would be fun to automate tweets that share the anticipation of an approaching Railscamp.

p. A rake task that uses the Twitter gem to share a tweet about the upcoming Railscamp 8 unconference via the Twitter API. Designed to be automated via crontab.

h2. How?

h3. Clone repo

p. Clone the repo to the machine on which you want the rake task to run.

h3. Store Twitter username and password

# Create a <code>.tweetsleeps</code> directory within the user's home directory
# Create <code>users.yml</code> within the <code>.tweetsleeps</code> directory and add the twitter username and password as follows:

<pre>
  <code>
    ---
    username: password
  </code>
</pre>

h3. Automate via crontab

p. Use <code>crontab -e</code> to define when the task should run, such as in the following example:

<pre>
  <code>
    15 8,16 * * * cd "/path/tweetsleeps_rc8"; rake tweet:sleeps[twitter_username]
  </code>
</pre>

h2. Who?
